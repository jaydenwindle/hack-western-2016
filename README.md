# Uplync - Meaningful connections. Made simple. 
Our team project for Hack Western 2016

We are currently continuing development on this idea in a private repo. This repo contains the original prototype which we built at Hack Western solely for the purposes of nostalgia. No changes will be made to this project in the future

## Disclaimer!
This repository is full of terrible awful no good very bad code. It is the product of no sleep, copious amounts of caffeine,
and almost zero prior knowledge of the framework we were working with. This is by no means production-ready code, or even 
alpha-ready code. 

That being said, we think that the idea behind this code is super cool, and we put a lot of effort into 
developing our idea. If you want to check out our award winning pitch deck (We won the "best pitch" competition sponsored by 
Deloitte Digital!) for this project, you can take a look at it 
[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxSf4hsygWu5aVFjeVg1OGI5ekE).

If you think this is a cool idea and want to help us develop it further, or if you just want to know more about it, go ahead and shoot us a message [here](http://jaydenwindle.com/contact/).
